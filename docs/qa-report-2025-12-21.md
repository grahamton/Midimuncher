# QA Report: 2025-12-21

## Summary

Performed a static analysis of `packages/core` and `apps/desktop` and ran full test suites.

## Fixes

- **`packages/core/src/index.ts`**: Removed duplicate export of `./sequencers/runner` (Previous).
- **`packages/core/src/engine`**: Deleted empty directory.

## Findings

### 1. App.tsx Refactor (Verified)

- **Status**: Significantly Improved.
- **Details**: `App.tsx` has been reduced from ~2737 lines to ~900 lines. Much of the state logic has been moved to `useAppController`.
- **Recommendation**: Continue monitoring. Further separation of concerns is good, but the "God Object" criticality is reduced.

### 2. Sequencer Logic (Confirmed)

- **`packages/core/src/sequencers/runner.ts`**: Confirmed that `collectEvents` returns either sequencer events OR step events.
- **Behavior**: If `sequencerId` is set for a step, generic `step.events` are ignored.
- **Note**: This appears to be intended design (Generative overrides Manual). If layering is desired, `collectEvents` would need modification to concat arrays.

## Test Results

- **apps/desktop**: PASS
- **packages/core**: PASS
