# QA Report: 2025-12-21

## Summary

Performed a static analysis of `packages/core` and `apps/desktop` and ran full test suites.
Validated recent **OXI One Integration** features including Transport Channel configuration.

## Recent Features (Configurable Transport)

### 1. Transport Channel Config (Verified)

- **Status**: Verified Fixed.
- **Details**:
  - Added `transportChannel` to `ProjectState`.
  - Added UI control in `SetupPage` (OXI Panel).
  - Fixed runtime error (prop drilling issue in `AppRouter`).
  - **Verification**: Verified via test suite and user confirmation (despite backend crash due to reload).

### 2. OXI UX Cohesion (Verified)

- **Status**: Implemented.
- **Details**:
  - **BPM Monitor**: Fixed "3 BPM" bug with windowed ticker.
  - **Auto-Connect**: App auto-selects OXI ports.
  - **Visuals**: Added "LINKED" badge.
  - **Bi-directional Transport**: Fixed OXI -> App transport sync.

## Findings

### 1. App.tsx Refactor (Verified)

- **Status**: Significantly Improved.
- **Details**: `App.tsx` has been reduced from ~2737 lines to ~900 lines. Much of the state logic has been moved to `useAppController`.
- **Recommendation**: Continue monitoring. Further separation of concerns is good, but the "God Object" criticality is reduced.

### 2. Backend Stability

- **Issue**: Backend (WinMM/RtMidi) prone to crashing on rapid reloads or invalid connection states ("Internal RtMidi error").
- **Mitigation**: Improved error handling in `midiBridge` to prevent renderer crashes, but requires app restart if backend process dies.

## Test Results

- **apps/desktop**: PASS (10 tests)
- **packages/core**: PASS (15 tests)
